===================================

.. _overview:

OpenMP Cluster (OMPC) FPGA is a framework that enables application developers to include FPGA acceleration by using only OpenMP standard directive, abstracting all of the FPGA handling.

This framework target AMD Alveo\ :sup:`TM` Boards, which are FPGA boards for High Performance Computing.
